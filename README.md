# Working with Markdown

## What markdown files are

A MARKDOWN file is a text file created using one of several possible dialects of the Markdown language. It uses plain text formatting but contains inline text symbols that specify how to format the text (e.g., *bold* for bold text, or other markups for italics, indentation, headers, etc.). MARKDOWN files are designed for writing documentation in plain text that can be easily converted to HTML.

## How to work with markdown files

Follow [this syntax guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for details on the format.
