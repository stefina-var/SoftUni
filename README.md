#  Loops

## What are loops and why are they used?

Loops are a way to repeat the same code multiple times.

## What are the different types of loops? Provide examples.

* for loop - 
```
for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression]){
   block of code to be executed
} 
initialExpression - the start
conditionExpression - condition for the end
incrementExpression - update the initialExpression
```
Variations of for are for...of used for arrays and for...in used for objects.
* while - 
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.
```
while (condition){
    block of code to be executed
}
``` 
* do...while - 
The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
```
do{
    block of code to be executed
}
while (condition);
``` 
The main difference is that in this one the statement is executed at least once!
